# ~ TildaBot & NodeJS
This is **Discord** Bot (TildaBot) ✌ To work with the Tilde, you will need several libraries. Such as: discord.js, quick.db, better-sqlite3. ✍

I advise you to open config.js, there you can specify data from your bot to use the source code:
```js

module.exports = {
    botClientID: "Here is your bot's ID",
    botPrefix: "Here is your prefix",
    ownerID: "Here is your ID",
    embedColor: "#199532",
    embedfooterText: "Here is your text"
}

```
